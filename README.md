 ABGen 1.0

 Revolutionary Blood Gas Analysis at Your Fingertips

ABGen 1.0 is a specialized medical software solution that transforms complex arterial blood gas data into actionable clinical insights, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions for healthcare professionals worldwide.



 Key Features

 Multiple Analysis Modes

- **Quick Mode**: Perfect for emergency situations. Input basic ABG values and receive instant interpretation with clinical suggestions in seconds. Includes acid-base status, compensation analysis, and treatment recommendations.

- **Advanced Mode**: Comprehensive analysis for complex cases. Includes detailed metabolic and respiratory assessment, anion gap analysis, strong ion difference calculations, and multi-parameter interpretation with clinical context.

- **Simulation Mode**: Educational tool for students and professionals to master blood gases interpretation through interactive simulation. Adjust parameters and observe real-time effects on blood gas values.

 Comprehensive Analysis Components

- **Primary Acid-Base Analysis**: Identifies acid-base disorders (acidosis/alkalosis), determines respiratory or metabolic origin, evaluates compensation status, and assesses severity with clinical context

- **Anion Gap Analysis**: Calculates anion gap with albumin correction, performs delta ratio analysis, detects mixed high/normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, and identifies potential toxic ingestions

- **Strong Ion Difference (SID)**: Applies Stewart's physicochemical approach to measure apparent/effective SID and strong ion gap, providing insights into complex acid-base disorders not evident with traditional parameters

- **Total Body Buffer Base (TBB)**: Evaluates buffer capacity and acid-base reserve beyond traditional parameters, assessing the body's ability to respond to acid-base challenges

- **Chloride Analysis**: Employs multiple calculation methods to estimate chloride levels with reliability scoring

- **Henderson-Hasselbalch Validation**: Verifies internal consistency of measurements using the classic acid-base equation, identifying potential laboratory errors or unmeasured ions

- **Electrolyte Pattern Analysis**: Evaluates complex electrolyte relationships, ratios, and patterns to identify disorders, predict ECG changes, and assess fluid status

- **Renal Function Assessment**: Analyzes renal contribution to acid-base status, identifies potential renal tubular disorders, and evaluates renal compensation mechanisms

 Simulation Features

- **Physiological Modeling**: Real-time simulation of respiratory and metabolic parameters based on advanced physiological models, including temperature effects, hypoxic drive, and Haldane effect

- **Interactive Parameters**: Adjust respiratory rate, SpO2, temperature, blood glucose, and blood pressure to observe immediate effects on blood gases values

- **Clinical Scenarios**: Pre-configured clinical cases spanning common and rare acid-base disorders with varying levels of complexity

- **Dynamic Compensation**: Observe how the body compensates for primary disorders in real-time, with accurate time-course modeling

- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visualization of parameter relationships and physiological responses through intuitive interface

- **Customizable Scenarios**: Create and save custom patient scenarios for repeated practice or educational demonstrations



- **Cross-Platform**: Available on iOS, Android, and Windows devices
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **HIPAA Compliant**: Designed with patient privacy in mind
- **Real-time Results**: Instant analysis for critical decision-making
- **Patient History Tracking**: Monitor trends and progress
- **Export Capabilities**: Share and document findings easily
- **Customizable Reference Ranges**: Adapt to local laboratory standards
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in multiple languages
